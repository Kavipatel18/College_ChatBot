Principal's Message
Prof. (Dr.) Indrajit Patel
Principal
Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College (BVM), an institution with strong historical values, a sustained legacy and add on success stories since 14 June, 1948.  A pioneer institution under the esteemed Charutar Vidya Mandal, has been at the forefront of engineering education since its establishment. Inspired by the visionary leadership of Bharat Ratna Shri Sardar Patel and bolstered by the generous support of Shri Ghanshyamdasji Birla, working with the motto of “WORK IS WORSHIP”, BVM continues to redefine excellence in education, aligning with the transformative vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. BVM has continually evolved to provide a world-class learning environment focused on research-based education and innovation.
I am delighted to announce that BVM stands as the sole autonomous engineering college in Gujarat accredited with NAAC. This prestigious recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to academic quality, innovation, and holistic development. As the only autonomous engineering college in the state, BVM has the freedom to design and implement curriculum frameworks that are agile, industry-aligned, and conducive to the holistic growth of students. This autonomy empowers us to adapt swiftly to emerging trends in engineering education, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and nurture a culture of innovation and research.
In line with this commitment, we are proud to introduce major and minor degree courses, offering students the flexibility to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career aspirations. These courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge in specialized fields while allowing students to explore interdisciplinary areas, fostering a holistic understanding of engineering principles.
Furthermore, we are excited to launch semester-long internships and summer internship as an integral part of our curriculum. These internships offer students hands-on experience in real-world settings, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and develop essential skills for professional success. To further enhance the learning experience, we offer a range of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide flexible learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in various domains. These courses are designed to complement our regular curriculum and offer additional pathways for students to explore their interests and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
Over the years, BVM has empowered over 20,000+ engineers, offering unparalleled facilities such as state-of-the-art smart classrooms, laboratories, an extensive library, modern computing infrastructure, recreational amenities, and accommodation. Our commitment to excellence has been recognized through accolades such as the World Bank Assistance Project TEQIP II & III, prestigious state government projects like SSIP 1.0 & 2.0, and numerous financial awards from national technical bodies like AICTE, DST, GujCost and GTU.

I am delighted to announce that BVM stands as the sole autonomous engineering college in Gujarat accredited with NAAC. This prestigious recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to academic quality, innovation, and holistic development. As the only autonomous engineering college in the state, BVM has the freedom to design and implement curriculum frameworks that are agile, industry-aligned, and conducive to the holistic growth of students. This autonomy empowers us to adapt swiftly to emerging trends in engineering education, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and nurture a culture of innovation and research.
In line with this commitment, we are proud to introduce major and minor degree courses, offering students the flexibility to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career aspirations. These courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge in specialized fields while allowing students to explore interdisciplinary areas, fostering a holistic understanding of engineering principles.
Furthermore, we are excited to launch semester-long internships and summer internship as an integral part of our curriculum. These internships offer students hands-on experience in real-world settings, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and develop essential skills for professional success. To further enhance the learning experience, we offer a range of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide flexible learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in various domains. These courses are designed to complement our regular curriculum and offer additional pathways for students to explore their interests and stay updated with the latest industry trends.

Frequently Asked Questions
When does campus recruitment season begin?
Normally, the campus placement begins at the pre-final/final semester. It commences around the end
                    of June and goes on till the end of academic year.
What are the eligibility criteria to register for the campus placements?

AMCAT Score in English Comprehension (475+)
Wheebox Employability Test Score (70+)
How can I register myself for on-campus placement process?
All the final year students who want to participate in Placement Drives of our college MUST provide
                    their consent for the same through Consent Letter provided on the website.
Can any student quit the placement procedure midway during the process?
A student who applies and gets shortlisted is bound to go through the entire selection process
                    unless rejected midway by the company. Any student who withdraws deliberately in the middle of a
                    selection process will be disallowed for placement for the rest of the academic year.
What are the stages of the recruitment process?
The following are the typical stages of recruitment â elimination happens at every stage:
Pre-placement Talk (PPT)
Aptitude Test / Technical Test (Online/Pen and Paper)
Group Discussion (GD)
Personal Interview (PI)
Technical & HR Interview
Please note that the recruitment procedures differ from company to company, so it is not necessary
                    that above mentioned stages will be a part of every companyâs recruitment procedure.
Can a student get more than one job offers?
It is possible for a student to receive more than one job offers if he/she has applied for multiple
                    companiesâ placement procedure (eg: a student sits for placement in two companies A and B). However,
                    once the student gets selected in anyone of the companies, he/she will be prohibited to sit in any
                    of the further placement drives occurring at the campus.
Will the results be declared on the same day of the campus placements?
The result declaration of the campus placement does not happen on the same day, it is uncertain and
                    depends on the company.
If I am awaiting results in one company, am I eligible to attend in placement drives of other
                    companies?
You are eligible till the final results are declared by the earlier company. If you are selected
                    then it is mandatory to take earlier offer.

It is possible for a student to receive more than one job offers if he/she has applied for multiple

                    companies?
You are eligible till the final results are declared by the earlier company. If you are selected
                    then it is mandatory to take earlier offer.

Udaan
As a humble beginning towards empowerment of our student culture through technology and advancement in the field of culture to create a better tomorrow, BVM Engineering College organizes a techno-cultural fest “Udaan – An Euphoric leap” every year. This Techno-cultural Festival provided the students with opportunities to explore and enhance their Technological and Cultural interests and motivated them to execute their thoughts in this real world.
Udaan crossed the boundaries of BVM by inviting Industry professionals and well-known professors of other colleges to judge events and to motivate students. Apart from these events, UDAAN is also comprised of a Fun zone & Food court. An Education Fair and Informative Seminar was organized during UDAAN with the help of various leading Academies to guide students about different career options after engineering. Local Newspapers and News channels appreciated UDAAN in their coverages..
Udaan crossed the boundaries of BVM by taking a splendid initiative to organize “BVM Talks” and thereby inviting well-known speakers throughout the nation like Padma Shri Gennabhai Patel, Ruzan Khambhatta, Rameshwar Bhatt, and Avni Sethi, who shared milestones of their achievements by spreading the horizon of their knowledge and thereby motivating the students.
The Glory of the Nights was Different. Along with these technical events, UDAAN comprised of 4 Splendid Nights.
The annual night of the Udaan 2018 “KALRAV” showed up with the melodious music and dance performances by the students of our college, and this was followed by the RED CARPET AWARDS and award distribution ceremony of the APEX committee, CORE committee, and Training and Placement Cell Coordinators. These overwhelming performances bring to the end of the Magnificent Techno-Cultural festival “UDAAN”.
Now Udaan has been a tradition of BVM and aspirations to make it better next time are the fuel of BVMites. Udaan had been successful in giving wings and direction to every budding dream of youth.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME (TEQIP) PHASE-II
(Source: http://www.npiu.nic.in/PDF/PIP-TEQIP-II%20for%20Web.pdf)
Introduction:
Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) was envisaged in 2003 as a long-term Programme of about 10-12 years duration to be implemented in 3 phases for transformation of the Technical Education System. As per TEQIP concept and design, each phase is required to be designed on the basis of lessons learnt from implementation of an earlier phase. TEQIP-I1 started a reform process in 127 institutions. The reform process needs to be sustained and scaled-up for embedding gains in the system and taking the transformation to a higher level. To continue the development activities initiated through TEQIP-I, a sequel project is planned as TEQIP-II2. The Project duration shall be for four years (2010-2014).
TEQIP Goal:
To scale-up and support ongoing efforts of the Government of India to improve quality of Technical Education and enhance existing capacities of the institutions to become dynamic, demand-driven, quality conscious, efficient and forward looking, responsive to rapid economic and technological developments occurring at the local, State, National and International levels. It has a clear focus on the objectives to improve the overall quality of existing Engineering Education.
Project Objectives:
The Project will focus on the following objectives:
Strengthening institutions to produce high quality Engineers for better employability.
Scaling-up Postgraduate Education and demand-driven Research & Development and Innovation.
Establishing Centres of Excellence for focused applicable research,
Training of faculty for effective Teaching.
Enhancing Institutional and System Management effectiveness.
Project Strategy:
The Project will be implemented in pursuance of the National Policy on Education (NPE-1986 revised in 1992) through the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India as a “Centrally Sponsored Scheme” with matching contribution from the State Governments and Union Territories (UTs). The Project cost will be shared by MHRD and States and private unaided institutions. Project cost in the funded and aided institutions for all sub-components will be shared between the Central Government and State governments in the ratio of 75:25 by all States except the Special Category States for which the ratio will be 90:10. For Centrally Funded Institutions, the entire Project cost will be borne by MHRD.
Project Design:
The Project is composed of following Components and Sub-components:
Component - 1 : Improving Quality of Education in Selected Institutions
Sub-Component 1.1 : Strengthening institutions to improve learning outcomes and employability of graduates.
Sub-Component 1.2 : Scaling-up Postgraduate Education and Demand-Driven Research & Development and Innovation
Sub-Sub-Component 1.2.1 : Establishing Centres of Excellence
Sub-Component 1.3 : Faculty Development for Effective Teaching (Pedagogical Training)
Component - 2 : Improving System Management
Sub-Component 2.1 : Capacity Building to Strengthen Management
Sub-Component 2.2 : Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

Welcome to NAAC
National Assessment and Accreditation Council
India has one of the largest and diverse education systems in the world. Privatization, widespread expansion, increased autonomy and introduction of Programmes in new and emerging areas have improved access to higher education. At the same time, it has also led to widespread concern on the quality and relevance of the higher education. To address these concerns, the National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986) and the Programme of Action (PoA, 1992) spelt out strategic plans for the policies, advocated the establishment of an independent National accreditation agency. Consequently, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) with its Head Quarter in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC as reflected in its vision statement is in making quality assurance an integral part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).
The NAAC functions through its General Council (GC) and Executive Committee (EC) comprising educational administrators, policy makers and senior academicians from a cross-section of Indian higher education system. The Chairperson of the UGC is the President of the GC of the NAAC, the Chairperson of the EC is an eminent academician nominated by the President of GC (NAAC). The Director is the academic and administrative head of NAAC and is the member-secretary of both the GC and the EC. In addition to the statutory bodies that steer its policies and core staff to support its activities NAAC is advised by the advisory and consultative committees constituted from time to time.

Student Information Systems (SIS) : -   With the help of an Alumni, we have designed an online “Student Information System” and Mobile App for EC branch through which any students’ academic & personal record can be assessed easily. Faculties can share their material online as well. Many faculties and students have been benefited because of that. Regularly results are uploaded to track the academic records of the students and guide them based on their requirements.       Link :- (sis.hashmedia.in/)

Principal's Message
Prof. (Dr.) Indrajit Patel
Principal
Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College (BVM), an institution with strong historical values, a sustained legacy and add on success stories since 14 June, 1948.  A pioneer institution under the esteemed Charutar Vidya Mandal, has been at the forefront of engineering education since its establishment. Inspired by the visionary leadership of Bharat Ratna Shri Sardar Patel and bolstered by the generous support of Shri Ghanshyamdasji Birla, working with the motto of “WORK IS WORSHIP”, BVM continues to redefine excellence in education, aligning with the transformative vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. BVM has continually evolved to provide a world-class learning environment focused on research-based education and innovation.
I am delighted to announce that BVM stands as the sole autonomous engineering college in Gujarat accredited with NAAC. This prestigious recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to academic quality, innovation, and holistic development. As the only autonomous engineering college in the state, BVM has the freedom to design and implement curriculum frameworks that are agile, industry-aligned, and conducive to the holistic growth of students. This autonomy empowers us to adapt swiftly to emerging trends in engineering education, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and nurture a culture of innovation and research.
In line with this commitment, we are proud to introduce major and minor degree courses, offering students the flexibility to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career aspirations. These courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge in specialized fields while allowing students to explore interdisciplinary areas, fostering a holistic understanding of engineering principles.
Furthermore, we are excited to launch semester-long internships and summer internship as an integral part of our curriculum. These internships offer students hands-on experience in real-world settings, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and develop essential skills for professional success. To further enhance the learning experience, we offer a range of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide flexible learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in various domains. These courses are designed to complement our regular curriculum and offer additional pathways for students to explore their interests and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
Over the years, BVM has empowered over 20,000+ engineers, offering unparalleled facilities such as state-of-the-art smart classrooms, laboratories, an extensive library, modern computing infrastructure, recreational amenities, and accommodation. Our commitment to excellence has been recognized through accolades such as the World Bank Assistance Project TEQIP II & III, prestigious state government projects like SSIP 1.0 & 2.0, and numerous financial awards from national technical bodies like AICTE, DST, GujCost and GTU.
BVM is awarded for Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan National Award-2019 for engineering college having over all best performance by Indian society of Technical Education, New Delhi. One and only Member from Gujarat state of BRICS association.  NPTEL Local Chapter has achieved rank nationally from A to AAA rating. Awards by Red Cross Society for highest blood unit collections, Winners in ROBOFEST 1.0, 2.0 & 3.0, IEEE Best Chapter award, Devang Mehta IT Award, Hackathon winners and more feathers are there with Institute in curricular-cocurricular-extracurricular fronts.
Drawing from a pool of meritorious students from Gujarat, BVM maintains an exceptional placement record, with over 100 corporates participating in campus interviews annually, leading to the placement of more than 95% of eligible and interested students. Students cracks GPSC,UPSC, GATE,CAT and other competitive examination with handsome score to path career ways in higher education at National and International premier institutions-universities including NIT,IIT,IIM.
At BVM, we prioritize the organization and effective participation of our students in various events such as Hackathons, Ideations, Robofest, Tech fest, Cultural, Sports, outreach programs and many activities/competitions, recognizing their integral role in fostering holistic development. Through these platforms, students are encouraged to showcase their problem-solving abilities, creativity, and technical expertise, culminating in practical solutions to real-world challenges.

Principal's Message
Prof. (Dr.) Indrajit Patel
Principal
Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College (BVM), an institution with strong historical values, a sustained legacy and add on success stories since 14 June, 1948.  A pioneer institution under the esteemed Charutar Vidya Mandal, has been at the forefront of engineering education since its establishment. Inspired by the visionary leadership of Bharat Ratna Shri Sardar Patel and bolstered by the generous support of Shri Ghanshyamdasji Birla, working with the motto of “WORK IS WORSHIP”, BVM continues to redefine excellence in education, aligning with the transformative vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. BVM has continually evolved to provide a world-class learning environment focused on research-based education and innovation.
I am delighted to announce that BVM stands as the sole autonomous engineering college in Gujarat accredited with NAAC. This prestigious recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to academic quality, innovation, and holistic development. As the only autonomous engineering college in the state, BVM has the freedom to design and implement curriculum frameworks that are agile, industry-aligned, and conducive to the holistic growth of students. This autonomy empowers us to adapt swiftly to emerging trends in engineering education, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and nurture a culture of innovation and research.
In line with this commitment, we are proud to introduce major and minor degree courses, offering students the flexibility to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career aspirations. These courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge in specialized fields while allowing students to explore interdisciplinary areas, fostering a holistic understanding of engineering principles.
Furthermore, we are excited to launch semester-long internships and summer internship as an integral part of our curriculum. These internships offer students hands-on experience in real-world settings, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and develop essential skills for professional success. To further enhance the learning experience, we offer a range of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide flexible learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in various domains. These courses are designed to complement our regular curriculum and offer additional pathways for students to explore their interests and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
Over the years, BVM has empowered over 20,000+ engineers, offering unparalleled facilities such as state-of-the-art smart classrooms, laboratories, an extensive library, modern computing infrastructure, recreational amenities, and accommodation. Our commitment to excellence has been recognized through accolades such as the World Bank Assistance Project TEQIP II & III, prestigious state government projects like SSIP 1.0 & 2.0, and numerous financial awards from national technical bodies like AICTE, DST, GujCost and GTU.
BVM is awarded for Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan National Award-2019 for engineering college having over all best performance by Indian society of Technical Education, New Delhi.

Drawing from a pool of meritorious students from Gujarat, BVM maintains an exceptional placement record, with over 100 corporates participating in campus interviews annually, leading to the placement of more than 95% of eligible and interested students. Students cracks GPSC,UPSC, GATE,CAT and other competitive examination with handsome score to path career ways in higher education at National and International premier institutions-universities including NIT,IIT,IIM.
At BVM, we prioritize the organization and effective participation of our students in various events such as Hackathons, Ideations, Robofest, Tech fest, Cultural, Sports, outreach programs and many activities/competitions, recognizing their integral role in fostering holistic development. Through these platforms, students are encouraged to showcase their problem-solving abilities, creativity, and technical expertise, culminating in practical solutions to real-world challenges. We provide a supportive ecosystem for students to prepare for and engage in these events, offering access to mentors, workshops, resources, and infrastructure necessary for project development and competition preparation.

We provide ample opportunities for international exposure and interaction with experts, facilitated by credit transfer arrangements and MOUs with premier industries, National & foreign universities.
At BVM, we recognize that learning extends beyond the classroom. Therefore, we have established a vibrant ecosystem of extracurricular activities aimed at holistic development. Our students actively participate in various chapters and clubs such as IEEE, TRS, IE(I), IETE, NCC, NSS, CSI, GFG, AI-ML Club, and the student central committee where they engage in community service, leadership development, and technical innovation. Through these initiatives, we aim to foster a culture of lifelong learning and personal growth, empowering our students to become well-rounded individuals poised to make meaningful contributions to society.
Our faculty members, comprising experienced academics and researchers, committed for the holistic development of students are actively engaged in R&D projects funded by state and international agencies, as well as providing consultancy services across various sectors. To ensure our graduates are industry-ready for the demands of Industry 4.0, we have instituted robust industry-institute interaction programs, fostering collaborations between faculty and industry experts, thereby facilitating academia-industry partnerships and fostering innovation.

BVM has continually evolved to provide a world-class learning environment focused on research-based education and innovation.
I am delighted to announce that BVM stands as the sole autonomous engineering college in Gujarat accredited with NAAC. This prestigious recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to academic quality, innovation, and holistic development. As the only autonomous engineering college in the state, BVM has the freedom to design and implement curriculum frameworks that are agile, industry-aligned, and conducive to the holistic growth of students. This autonomy empowers us to adapt swiftly to emerging trends in engineering education, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and nurture a culture of innovation and research.
In line with this commitment, we are proud to introduce major and minor degree courses, offering students the flexibility to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career aspirations. These courses are designed to provide in-depth knowledge in specialized fields while allowing students to explore interdisciplinary areas, fostering a holistic understanding of engineering principles.
Furthermore, we are excited to launch semester-long internships and summer internship as an integral part of our curriculum. These internships offer students hands-on experience in real-world settings, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and develop essential skills for professional success. To further enhance the learning experience, we offer a range of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide flexible learning opportunities for students to gain knowledge in various domains. These courses are designed to complement our regular curriculum and offer additional pathways for students to explore their interests and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
